    Hello <b>{{ registration.firstName }} {{ registration.lastName }}</b>,
</p>
<p>
    This will be a long post. We ask that you read it in its entirety as the answers you are looking
    for are more than likely in here.
</p>
<p>
    Ever since 2004 we at Anime Detour have sought to provide a safe and inclusive convention
    for all fans of anime, manga, and gaming in the Twin Cities area. Making the decision to
    cancel this year was not an easy one, but  in light of the COVID-19 pandemic it was one that
    had to be made for the safety of our attendees, guests, and staff.
</p>
<p>
    Our partner hotels -- The Hyatt, Hilton, and Millennium -- will be canceling all rooms
    that were booked through our hotel links, with a refund of any deposits, and you will be
    receiving an email notice of its cancellation. If you booked in a different hotel or through
    a 3rd party we suggest contacting them to cancel as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Rollovers to next year's convention (April 2-4, 2021) will be automatically processed. If you
    would prefer a refund or to donate your registration fee, please fill out the form at the link
    at the end of this paragraph. All donations will go to Anime Twin Cities to fund events such as
    Anime Detour and other free activities such as Outpost Anime, Cosplay on Ice, and Akihabara Anime
    Market. This form must be filled out by June 1st. Please keep in mind that the refunds will not be
    immediate; while we will work on getting them out as fast as we are able, we are an all-volunteer
    staff and this process will take time.

    If you need to fill out the form, your confirmation number is {{ registration.confirmationNumber }}.
</p>
<p>
    We will do our best to make sure that everyone who pre-ordered t-shirts gets them. Shirts will be
    available at our 2021 convention, and we are looking at alternative options to get them to those
    who choose not to roll over their memberships. The AD Merchandise department will send out emails
    to those who had purchased the shirts once we have set up systems for delivery or pickup.
</p>
<p>
    We will be putting together a list of the artists and vendors who were selected this year along
    with their websites. Please look out for this list if you would like to support these artists
    and vendors. All artists and vendors will receive a full refund of any fees they may have paid
    to attend this year's convention.
</p>
<p>
    If you have further questions on any of the processes please reach out to the respective departments.
    You can find their emails on our website: https://www.animedetour.com/contact

<p>
    Thank you all for your patience and understanding during this difficult time, and we look forward to
    seeing you back in 2021.
